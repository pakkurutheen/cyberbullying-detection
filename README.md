# Cyberbullying Detection on Social Media Platforms

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect instances of cyberbullying on social media platforms. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various classification algorithms, the system can identify harmful or abusive content and help mitigate its impact on users.

## Introduction:

Cyberbullying is a significant issue on social media platforms, affecting users' mental health and well-being. This project seeks to develop a robust model capable of detecting cyberbullying in text data, thus providing a tool for social media companies and researchers to combat online abuse.

## Features:

<li>Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess text data for better model performance.</li>
<li>Feature Extraction: Extract meaningful features using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.</li>
<li>Model Training: Train various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVM, and deep learning models like XG Boost.</li>
<li>Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
<li>Deployment: Provide scripts for deploying the trained model for real-time detection.</li>

## Installation:

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyberbullying-detection.git
    cd cyberbullying-detection

2.Create a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

3.Install the required packages:
 
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage:

Datasets:

The datasets used for training and evaluation are included in the data/ directory. These datasets contain examples of both bullying and non-bullying text. You can also use your own datasets by placing them in the appropriate directory and updating the paths in the scripts.

<li>Preprocess Data: Run the preprocessing script to clean the data.</li>
<li>Train Model: Train the model using the processed data.</li>
<li>Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.</li>
<li>Detect Cyberbullying: Use the trained model to detect cyberbullying in new text data.</li>



## Models:

The following models are implemented in this project:

<li>Deep Learning Model</li>
<li>Xg Boost algorithm</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>

## Results:

The results of the trained models, including performance metrics and visualizations, are available in the 'results/' directory. Detailed evaluation reports and plots can help understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
